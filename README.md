# doccolink-scripts

Put these scripts in `/home/ubuntu` on the AWS EC2 machine (the scripts should be on the same level as the `Doccolink-Development-Repo` directory).

Use `sudo ./init_app.sh` to initialize DoccoLink for the first time.

Use `sudo ./update_app.sh` to update DoccoLink after you make changes to the master branch of the main DoccoLink repository.
